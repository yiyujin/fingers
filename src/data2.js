Final Output:
Customized tactile controller for an app.

I want to isolate, or free apps from my smartphone. I feel like all these apps are imprisoned because their interactions are confined to the given screen (and guidelines from Google and Apple).
As a method of doing that, **I want to explore various finger compositions.** Thumb presses pretty much rule the current screen-based interaction. But we have 10 fingers!
I also want to drive away from visual senses and discover ways for smooth interactions that don’t require people to look.


What's Next :
I want to develop the project to mini pcomp projects.


Disconnect to Connect :
I bought this radio for over $200. I could just download a radio app on a phone for free, but I didn’t want to. I think an interaction includes pre and post stages too. What I mean by that in case of radio, is that all these stages matter: walking up to the radio, tuning into radio, listening to it, turning it off. This radio offered distinct analog interactions for each stage. If if it were on a phone, it would just be press-press-press.
